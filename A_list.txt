Certainly! The article I authored for ABB's review journal explores the carbon emissions from EV battery production and use. It analyzes the lifetime carbon footprint of a battery electric vehicle (BEV), including the carbon emissions associated with the production of the battery and the car itself, as well as the emissions generated during the vehicle's use. The main findings of the article demonstrate that BEVs already have lower emissions than the most efficient internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles in Europe and the United States and that these emissions are mainly generated during the use phase of both types of vehicles. The article also discusses the impact of grid decarbonization on BEV emissions and how countries adopting more renewable energy sources will make the BEV value proposition even more attractive.
According to the article, the technical aspects of battery production and use that contribute to the carbon footprint of both BEVs and ICE vehicles were estimated in detail. For battery production, a nickel manganese cobalt (NMC) type of lithium-ion battery chemistry was considered, and battery materials, cell manufacturing, and pack and module assembly were included in the study. Future scenarios were estimated based on an increasing battery energy density. For the BEV use phase, power grid COâ‚‚ emissions in the EU, USA, and China were linearly extrapolated from 2020 to 2030, and a further 25 percent was added to emissions to account for upstream losses during electricity enabling emissions reduction in grid power generation. For ICE vehicles, fuel "well-to-tank" and exhaust emission data were collected. In both ICE and BEV vehicles, it was found that the primary contribution to emissions arises during the use phase.
